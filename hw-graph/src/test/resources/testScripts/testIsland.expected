# Tests that a graph contains isolated nodes, all nodes
# can be printed and all edges from each node can be printed

# Create a graph
created graph island

# Add nodes
added node n1 to island
added node n2 to island
added node n3 to island

# Add Edges (isolate n3)
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in island
added edge e21 from n2 to n1 in island

# print all nodes in the graph and all edges from each node
island contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in island are: n2(e12)
the children of n2 in island are: n1(e21)
the children of n3 in island are:

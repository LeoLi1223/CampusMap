# Tests that a graph has a cycle in it, all nodes can be
# printed and all edges can be printed.

# Create a graph
created graph cycle

# Add nodes
added node n1 to cycle
added node n2 to cycle
added node n3 to cycle

# Add edges
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in cycle
added edge e23 from n2 to n3 in cycle
added edge e31 from n3 to n1 in cycle

# Print all nodes and edges
cycle contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in cycle are: n2(e12)
the children of n2 in cycle are: n3(e23)
the children of n3 in cycle are: n1(e31)
